          1 (one, unit, unity) is a number, numeral, and glyph. It is the first
          and smallest positive integer of the infinite sequence of natural
          numbers. This fundamental property has led to its unique uses in other
          fields, ranging from science to sports, where it commonly denotes the
          first, leading, or top thing in a group. Historically, the
          representation of 1 evolved from ancient Sumerian and Babylonian
          symbols to the modern Arabic numeral.

          2 (two) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number
          following 1 and preceding 3. It is the smallest and the only even
          prime number. Because it forms the basis of a duality, it has
          religious and spiritual significance in many cultures.

          3 (three) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number
          following 2 and preceding 4, and is the smallest odd prime number and
          the only prime preceding a square number. It has religious and
          cultural significance in many societies.[1]
